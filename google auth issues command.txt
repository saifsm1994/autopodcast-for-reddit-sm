Note to self:

Ubuntu has issues with google auth for the text to speech api: 

There is a new line in the key file which causes the auth program to be unable to read the json key if it is copied
and pasted into a new blank file

Additionally the other forms of auth have an issue in which the wrong or nonexistant account is used which then fails the api call

The solution:

FTP over the key, place the server in the ftp directory, and run the following command

gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=../../ftp/files/auto-podcast-sm-c29cba978f70.json


where the keyfile position is changed to wherever it actually is
